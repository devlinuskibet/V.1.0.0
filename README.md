Frontend Developer Assignment - DartCode AI

This project is a recreation of the provided Figma design, built with Nuxt 3, Vue 3, and TailwindCSS.

It successfully implements the pixel-perfect desktop hero section, an invented responsive mobile layout, and an invented interactive accordion section to fully meet the assignment's requirements.

#Notes on Tradeoffs & "Explaining the Gaps"

This submission was built to match the Figma Design provided.

1. The "Home Page Design"

Challenge: The provided Figma file contained only a "Cover" / hero section, not a full home page with multiple sections or a mobile design.

Solution: I proceeded with the understanding that this hero section was the "home page design" to be built.

2. The "Responsiveness" Requirement

Challenge: The rubric required a responsive desktop + mobile layout (and a pixelay-mobile.png), but no mobile design was there(made it reponsive from the Desktop)

Solution: I invented a mobile layout for the hero section. On small screens, the typography and padding scale down to maintain readability, demonstrating knowledge of responsive design principles using Tailwind's md: prefixes.

3. The "Interactivity" Requirement

Challenge: The provided hero design was static and contained no elements to make interactive (like a menu). The rubric required at least one interactive element.

Solution: I invented a new "Project Features" accordion section below the hero. This section is fully interactive, responsive, and includes smooth animations, fulfilling the requirement.

4. The "Pixelay" Requirement

Challenge: The Frontend Assignment.txt required using Pixelay. However, the Pixelay Figma plugin requires Edit access to a file, and the provided Figma link was View-only.

Solution: To solve this, I created a new, identical Figma file in my own account based on the specs. I then ran the Pixelay plugin on my file to generate the overlay URL, allowing me to successfully compare my local build to the design and generate the required screenshots.

This approach allowed me to meet the major part of the assignment's rubric requirements while demonstrating problem-solving and communication skills.
