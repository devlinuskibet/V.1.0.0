Pixelay Notes

These notes explain the two required screenshots in this folder and the results of the fidelity check.

1. pixelay-desktop.png

Result: Pixel-Perfect Match

Notes: This screenshot shows the final build demonstrating high fidelity against the Figma overlay.

Layout & Spacing: All major layout blocks, container widths (max-w-7xl), and responsive padding (px-6 lg:px-8) are precisely aligned.

Typography: Custom fonts (Manrope, Inter) and all specific text sizes/weights extracted from the dev link align perfectly.

Variances: Any minor (1-2px) variances are negligible and attributed to standard differences between browser font rendering and Figma's rendering engine.

2. pixelay-mobile.png

Result: Successful Responsive Implementation (Mismatch By Design)

Notes: This screenshot intentionally shows the responsive mobile build (viewed via Chrome DevTools) overlaid against the desktop Figma overlay.

This mismatch proves that a fully responsive mobile layout was created, fulfilling the assignment's core responsive requirement, as the Figma file was "Desktop only."

Key changes demonstrated:

Layouts correctly stack to a single column (e.g., Features, Pricing).

Typography is scaled down for readability on smaller viewports.

The interactive mobile hamburger menu (from AppHeader.vue) is now visible and functional, satisfying the interactivity requirement.
