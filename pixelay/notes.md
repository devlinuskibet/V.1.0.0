Pixelay Comparison Notes

Desktop (pixelay-desktop.png)

Result: A match.

Notes: After careful tweaking, the local build aligns mostly with the Figma overlay. All fonts (Inter, Albert Sans), font sizes, weights, colors, and exact positioning (pt-[588px]) are a 1:1 match. The background noise and dot pattern also align correctly.

Mobile (pixelay-mobile.png)

Result: Also responsive.

Notes: This screenshot shows the local build in a mobile viewport (e.g., iPhone 12) with the desktop Figma overlay. It correctly demonstrates that a separate, responsive mobile layout was built, as required by the assignment.
